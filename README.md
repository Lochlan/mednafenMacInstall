mednafenMacInstall
==================

A shell script to install mednafen on Mac OS (supports 10.9)

To run the script download it and make it executable:
    $ chmod +x ~/Downloads/installMednafenMac.sh

To run it:

    $ ~/Downloads/installMednafenMac.sh

It will take a while (if you do not have gcc48 installed yet, be patient!).

You can then run mednafen from the terminal like so:

    $ mednafen NAMEOFROM

Enjoy!
